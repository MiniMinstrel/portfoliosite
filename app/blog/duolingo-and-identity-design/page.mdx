Nothing scares me more in this world than wasps.

A close second though? Probably someone with a triple digit Duolingo streak.

To those who are not one of the [130 million monthly active users](https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/01420520-3377-4985-887b-55ed3c1e4fc5) Duolingo has, the application touts a "gamified" approach to learning languages that makes the daunting idea a bit more approachable. Users walk a linear path to language mastery through bite-sized lessons every day, building up a streak day after day to keep the loveable (yet sadistic) mascot, Duo, happy.

It has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2012, where its sole goal was to lower the barrier to entry to education and bring a free way for people to learn another language. However, while Duolingo continues to pull [PR stunt after PR stunt](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/duolingo-experimenting-with-silence-amid-social-media-blackout/), I wanted to put Duolingo's core mechanic under the limelight: streaks. Once an extremely useful system to keep you motivated to learn, it has warped over time into something far more reflective of yourself...for better or for worse.

Like the clothes you wear or the car you drive, Duolingo streaks for people have become a status symbol. And it starts to call into question whether education is truly at its heart.

## Prestige in Your Palms

If you have used Duolingo recently and began your journey into learning a language, you've probably been met with a bright and flashy prompt after a few days of learning.

This is Duolingo's exclusive and prestigious club of learners known as the **Streak Society**. When it first launched in 2022, you were inducted into this group after reaching a year of consistent studying with Duolingo. Themed after the flame iconography their streaks take after, as well as leveraging the phoenix as a well-known icon across cultures, it serves as a universally acknowledgeable milestone of your committed learning.

This VIP group is not a new design choice for applications. Most apps nowadays enjoy touting a "premium" or "plus" version that separates them from the average user. Establishing an _in-group_ ([a term used to describe groups that people identify with and have an emotional attachment to](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/social-sciences-and-humanities/ingroups-and-outgroups)) is a strong option from a design standpoint to build a loyal user base. Now, instead of using a product, a user is a _part_ of something bigger than themselves, which reinforces long-term retention.

Being in an in-group also leads to a myriad of positive benefits for a user's self-esteem as well, which increases commitment further. The establishment of the Streak Society bolsters their self-esteem by reaffirming what they believe about themselves; by being in a group of disciplined, high achieving language learners, they too feel like they're disciplined and high achieving.

This is perfect for Duolingo, because a user that believes they have those qualities will continue to engage with the application, and down the line may even pay for their [increasingly prominent premium options](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/). They wouldn't dare try to break their streak, because if they did, they would lose a central part of their identity as a Duolingo user, and in turn, a central part about themselves as a learner.

> The establishment of the Streak Society bolsters their self-esteem by reaffirming what they believe about themselves; by being in a group of disciplined, high achieving language learners, they too feel like they're disciplined and high achieving.

This is the crux of what makes in-groups powerful tools in persuasive design. Behavior is governed by how people wish to be seen. If a user wishes to be seen as a person who is on a journey to learn a language, then Duolingo benefits by providing that recognition to them.

Now, others know that you are part of a larger community, whether it's by word of mouth, or its through the multiple avenues to display the achievement (for example, a [widget on your home screen](https://blog.duolingo.com/widget-feature/)). It provides a clear distinction between a Duolingo user and a _successful_ Duolingo user, which is what everyone wants to be perceived as.

However, there is a large hurdle to this issue: a year is a _long_ time to wait to reap the benefits of the Streak Society. The average user retention rate [drops to a meager 8%](https://onesignal.com/mobile-app-benchmarks-2024) after one month, so the competition to keep their user's attention is fierce.

Thankfully for Duolingo, a subtle change to how the Streak Society works (alongside a few additional features) allows more people into the in-group faster _without_ degrading the quality of the group itself.

## Spreading Like Wildfire

As hopeful as it is to assume users will stick around fully dedicated for a year, it's risky to rely solely on user behavior for that timeframe. As such, Duolingo needed to balance the quality and the standards of the in-group to satisfy both themselves and their users.

Their solution is clever, but deviously simple: **quietly reduce the Streak Society streak requirement from one year to one week.**

Keep in mind that no design indicators have changed because of this; users still receive the elaborate animation and celebratory messaging. There is still a badge by their name, the phoenix motifs are still present on the widget, etc.

The status is still perceived as "exclusive" and "rigorous", but the standards are lowered to where users receive that self-esteem boost earlier in their usage, rather than waiting for the payoff a year later.

This is perfect for Duolingo, as now instead of having to fight an 8% or worse retention rate, the average _7-day_ retention rate is a [much more generous 18%](https://onesignal.com/mobile-app-benchmarks-2024). Users are also satisfied since they get access to to all the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits of the Streak Society, without feeling like the status was degraded with the bar being lowered.

Furthermore, the push to establish a user early on via streaks and the Streak Society is complimented by just _how easy_ it is to keep a streak.

Streak Freezes, for example, help preserve streaks should learners forget to do their lessons that day, which is an amazing idea on paper. We all live busy lives, and a safety net ensures that our hard earned progress doesn't go to waste is always appreciated.

However, with the frequency at which Streak Freezes can be purchased (or even given as rewards for lessons), streaks can be maintained for months and months on end without logging in as often. Streak Freezes also don't count against the streak, so it still appears as though the streak if a perfect one; a symbol of a flawless, dedicated learner.

And should a streak get broken despite every guard rail, Duolingo is generous enough to even offer a _Streak Repair_, should you be willing to sit through a few short lessons to get it back.

All of these efforts are to ensure that the streak stays alive, due to the power it holds over the user. As the streak grows larger, so too does the perceived loss the user feels should they break a streak. This is textbook loss aversion, which makes the pain of loss feel stronger than earning something.

> Streak Freezes also don't count against the streak, so it still appears as though the streak if a perfect one; a symbol of a flawless, dedicated learner.

Loss aversion bypasses logic and appeals to emotion, which is the core of persuasive design techniques. Logically, the streak is not an indicator of your language learning process. Users are learning a language piece by piece regardless of how many days they show up in a row. However, when emotions begin to cloud a user's judgement, the tendency to take the path of least resistance grows stronger.

And when Duolingo presents these easy options to maintain the streak _without_ the negative effects of not being in the in-group, it becomes easier to let the true educational purpose of Duolingo take a backseat, and reap the benefits of a free status symbol.

## Is This Still About Learning?

I do want to take the time to acknowledge though that when used responsibly, these are _great_ systems that allow users to develop desirable habits in their daily lives. Streaks is not an unfamiliar concept, and when applied to a basic goal (such as learning languages or exercising), it adds [structure and a goal beyond the simple task](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-keeping-a-streak-boosts-your-motivation/).

If Duolingo didn't work for people, it wouldn't be as popular as it is now.

However, it's also important to note that Duolingo's design is [intentionally geared towards maximizing user retention](https://youtu.be/9KqrnBiyBQ8?t=142). Streaks, and the community that comes with it, are one piece of the puzzle that comes with ensuring active users remain active and become more likely to pay for premium services.

They have expertly accounted for both of the pain points in designing streaks: rewarding users earlier in the streak to keep it novel and exciting, and making the higher streaks easier to maintain to continue inflating its value. In short, these streaks become something of a spectacle: bright, bold, popular, and hard to look away from.

With those qualities though, it's easy to find it becoming a replacement over a user's sole reason for starting: learning a language. The appearance itself becomes a reward, but when it does, the process can begin to lose its luster. Does the joy from opening Duolingo come from building a streak so all can see the progress? Or is it from deepening your knowledge in a language and their culture?

> In short, these streaks become something of a spectacle: bright, bold, popular, and hard to look away from.

It can be both. But as Duolingo continues to hit the headlines with their newest marketing tricks, there is still a tricky balance between designing for engagement and designing for enrichment.

It's a challenge _all_ mobile UI/UX developers will have to face as the digital space continues to broaden, but perhaps Duolingo already has a winning formula up their feathered sleeves.
